# 🌍 Africa's Economic Giants: A Regional Revenue Analysis

This project is a full-stack data analysis exploring the top 100 companies in Africa by revenue. Using Python for web scraping, Excel for data transformation, and Tableau for visualization, I uncovered key insights on how revenue is distributed across industries, countries, and African regions.
